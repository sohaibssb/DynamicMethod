# DynamicMethod
Develop Dynamic Method for data consistency in distributed systems using advantages of CRDTs and Paxos Algorithms

Programmed by Sohaibssb as a part of master research about "Methods of Syncretization Data in Distribution System" at Bauman University, Moscow. Start in 2/10/2023

------------------

About the Dynamic method:

This program presents and implements a method that combines the strengths of conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) and Paxos algorithms, offering a dynamic approach to data consistency in distributed systems.
